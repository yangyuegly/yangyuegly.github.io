The title isn't entirely accurate because there are rather two things I wanted to talk about:

1. Why should we actively update the larger group on what we are working on?
2. Why should we speak with more conviction/be more assertive?

These are both things that Philip, my supervisor for my summer internship, encouraged me to work on after the first two weeks of the internship. Initially, when he asked me to share my data analysis result inside the organization's slack channel, I didn't feel completely comfortable with it. Although he was very happy with the findings, a completely irrational voice in my head kept telling me that everyone must be occupied with their own work and should not waste their precious time on reading my findings. Having noticed my discomfort, he shared with me his own experience as a Swedish person, coming from the "Japan in Europe", working in Geneva, and his journey of adapting to the different workstyle of colleagues from countries where people tend to be much more assertive.

While appreciating his advice, I also needed to convince myself that assertiveness and advertisement of my work serves some purpose other than my own need to be seen. Why should we actively share our work, in particular, those not ncessarily directly impact what others are working on, with the larger group?

One of the reason is that seeing others' work motivate us. Especially in a remote setting, with the lack of tangible stimuli, we need extra incentives that keep us excited about our work, or else we may quickly forget the bigger picture of our work in the organization. This is why small updates are helpful for everyone to see. (of course whether one chooses to read the update is completely voluntary)

Now to our second point, speaking with more conviction. Sometimes it's hard to tell conviction apart from enthusiasm; vice versa, it can be hard to tell hesitation apart from indifference.

Seeing Hao in his lab meeting really inspired me. Although it's quite difficult to raise a question

In the past, I have always waited to speak last in group meetings or activities, and yesterday was my first time to consciously avoid doing that in a group meeting. We were going around introducing ourselves in descending order of our birth date. I happened to be the first one that was supposed to speak. After Ben, who also has a late December birthday asks if someone has a later birthday than him, I chipped in and
