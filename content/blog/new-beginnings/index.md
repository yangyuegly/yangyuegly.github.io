You can find the react practice project [here](https://github-auth-udemy.herokuapp.com), built with the Auth0 API and Github API. I followed this react [tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-js-course/learn/lecture/6721532#overview).

I first worked with React when I took [weblab](http://weblab.mit.edu/) my first year during winter session. I enjoyed solidifying a bit more my knowledge on React through this course.
I learned about conveniently storing user state in localStorage, about lifecycle methods, about how I can fix the api “allowed-access-lock” by adding the .haccess file when I scrape data from github.
