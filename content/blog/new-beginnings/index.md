You can find the project [here](https://github-auth-udemy.herokuapp.com).

I first worked with React when I took [weblab](http://weblab.mit.edu/) my first year during winter session. I enjoyed solidifying a bit more my knowledge on React through this course.
I learned about conveniently storing user state in localStorage, about lifecycle methods, about how I can fix the api “allowed-access-lock” by adding the .haccess file.
